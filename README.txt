DBMS For Shootings in the United States

Shootings are a growing concern in the world’s most dominant economic and military power, the United States. This problem has been around for decades but it has heightened to nearly an uncontrollable level in recent years. In light of recent events, such as the Black Lives Matter movement, it is important for citizens to have access to this information. The primary purpose of this database is to improve transparency and accountability. Although statistics do not capture the full extent of the story, they allow for a better understanding of the situation. For example currently, people are trying to understand whether police are disproportionately targeting people of colour, but simply looking at percentages of victims by race would prove otherwise. However, with a comprehensive database with multiple descriptors such as whether the victim was armed or not provides a whole new dimension to the story. 

As a brief overview, our database application would include records of the number of shootings per state, information about the shooter (name, age, gender, race.), date of shooting, type of shooting (police, school etc.), number of deaths caused per year, how the person was killed (shot or tasered), if person was armed (gun, knife, other, none). Users can interact with the database in the following ways: they can contribute to the database (e.g. submit a shooting case, which must be approved by system administrators before being posted), discuss their thoughts with others either anonymously or by creating an account (this would require their full name, age, gender and email address) and subscribe to receive notifications when information is added or updated. Evidently, the database will be handling a large volume of data specifically from 2015 – present.

This application can be used by people who are curious about the correlations between certain individuals and their susceptibility to getting shot. It will bridge the gaps in their knowledge and hopefully lead to educated conclusions.
