Our database application includes records of the number of shootings per state, information about the shooter (name, age, gender, race.), date of shooting, type of shooting (police, school etc.), number of deaths caused per year, how the person was killed (shot or tasered), if person was armed (gun, knife, other, none). Users can interact with the database in the following ways: they can contribute to the database (e.g. submit a shooting case, which must be approved by system administrators before being posted), discuss their thoughts with others either anonymously or by creating an account (this would require their full name, age, gender and email address) and subscribe to receive notifications when information is added or updated. Evidently, the database will be handling a large volume of data specifically from 2015 â€“ present.

This application can be used by people who are curious about the correlations between certain individuals and their susceptibility to getting shot. It will bridge the gaps in their knowledge and hopefully lead to educated conclusions.
